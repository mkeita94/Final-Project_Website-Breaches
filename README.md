# Browsers Compatibility

The website was tested on Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, and Microsoft Edge. So, the website should successfully on these browsers.

# API

Data Breach Visualizer creates visualizations using public data about website breaches. This is from the Postman public API. The API endpoints can be found at https://haveibeenpwned.com/api/v2/breaches/

# Visualizations

The website visualizes the number of accounts breached per website for a specific with the option to see whether it includes sensitive data or not, and it also shows the type of data involved in a breach for a specific year. Both charts were created using Chart.js, a JavaScript library(https://www.chartjs.org/).

# HTML/CSS

The website was styled using pure CSS, using flexbox to organise the layout of the elements. All the webpages have a navigation menu at the top of the page (which includes links to the Home page, About page, and the Github page). The Home page contains both charts and their filters.

# Problem Statement

This project is trying to solve a knowledge gap issue dealing with the lack of information about data breaches that occured over the years. At this point, there is a public API that contains information about these incidents. However, people could not make sense of it by just looking at the data. As a result, this project will enable users visualize on a bar chart the number of accounts breached per company. Also, with the doughnut chart, they will see the proportion of data classes involved in the breaches for a specific year. Finally, this will help users make decisions about how to use the websites and decide whether it is safe to share any personal information.
