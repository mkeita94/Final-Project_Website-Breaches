            <p>
                <h3><b>What is the purpose of Data Breach Visualizer?</b></h3>
                The purpose of Data Breach Visualizer is to provide the history
                 of websitesâ€™ breaches that have occurred in order to help 
                 people in their decision making. The first graph shows the 
                 number of account breaches for some websites generated randomly
                , they can be filtered based on the sensitivity and the year in
                which it occurs. Moreover, the second graph provides a 
                 summary of breaches for each year, and it includes the proportion
                 dataclasses involved in the breach. For example, the number of
                 passwords breached in 2021, and so on
                 <h3><b>Where is the data from?</b></h3>
                 The data used for this visualization is from the list of Postman
                 OpenAPI which can be found <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/api/v2/breaches/">here</a> 
                 <h3><b>How to Use</b></h3>
                 It is simple to use the visualizations. For the first graph, 
                 there are two dropdown menus, and the first one let you select
                 "sensitive" or "non-sensitive" information, the second let you
                 pick the year which automatically update the chart based on both
                 conditions(sensitivity and year). In the case you see a pop up 
                 window, that means there is no data returned, and you need to 
                 the filters. <br>
