            <p>
                <h3><b>What is the purpose of Data Breach Visualizer?</b></h3>
                The purpose of Data Breach Visualizer is to provide the history
                 of websitesâ€™ breaches that have occurred in order to help 
                 people in their decision making. The first graph shows the 
                 number of account breaches for some websites generated randomly
                , they can be filtered based on the sensitivity and the year in
                which it occurs. Moreover, the second graph provides a 
                 summary of breaches for each year, and it includes the proportion
                 dataclasses involved in the breach. For example, the number of
                 passwords breached in 2021, and so on
                 <h3><b>Where is the data from?</b></h3>
                 The data used for this visualization is from the list of Postman
                 OpenAPI which can be found here<a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/api/v2/breaches/" target="_blank">

                 <h3><b>How to Use</b></h3>
                 <h4>Number of Accounts Breached per Company</h4>

                 It is simple to use the visualizations.  The chart generates 100 random
                 data point from the API and among those 100 endpoints.For the first graph, 
                 there are two dropdown menus, and the first one let you select
                 "sensitive" or "non-sensitive" information, the second let you
                 pick the year which automatically update the chart based on both
                 conditions(sensitivity and year). In the case you see a blank 
                 chart, that means there is no data returned, and you should update 
                 the filters. Finally, the refresh button allows to get fresh 
                 data and reinitialize the state of the chart.<br>

                 <h4>Number of Breaches related to Dataclasses</h4>

                 This second chart known as doughnt chart is simple to use. It
                 displays the frequency of each dataclass like passwords, emails, 
                 and IP addresses. The chart reads its data from the API and store
                 it into localstorage for a better user experience. 
                 There are one dropdown menu which let you
                 pick the year which automatically update the chart.
                 Finally, the refresh button allows to get fresh
